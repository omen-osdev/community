# Week 2 of the OMEN project

Hello everyone!

## Current state

We are starting by trimming the teams, the discord has grown huge and
we cannot actively manage everyone so we will make **tabula rasa** with
the teams. Do not worry, this was expected.

Please fill [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_2H0TcVQv4r8zkQGX24dZ7QYDwO6OIRlkUabk8arCc/edit?usp=sharing) link with to add yourself to a team, if you ever switch teams or
decide to move on and abandon this project, simply remove yourself from the list.
